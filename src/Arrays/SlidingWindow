sliding window

A array or string is given and we have to give substring or subarray as output
and a value K is given on which condition is given or maxima/minima is given

In this case we apply sliding window

There are two types of window

1. Variable size window
2. Fixed size window  :- size of subarray or substring is fixed


ex :- find maximum of k sized subarray whose value is maxm.

FIXED SIZED WINDOW

find answer of first window
Then add one number to window and subtract the last element(shrink) and update sum with maxm.


VARIABLE SIZED WINDOW

take two pointer si, ei and starts both from 0.
grow window ei till the length of array
shrink window if possible by increasing the si
