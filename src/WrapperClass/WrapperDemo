Wrapper class :- Non primitive data type in place of primitive data type is called wrapper class.
                Non primitive version of all primitive data type is called wrapper class
                int -----> Integer
                long-----> Long
                short-----> Short


Integer a = 10;
    Here , a will store address and stored in heap memory but it will display its value . we will learn

Autoboxing :-  when we convert primitive in nonprimitive is called autoboxing
            Integer a = 10;
            int a1 = 10;
            a = a1;          // Autoboxing

Unboxing :- when we convert nonprimitive data type into primitive data type then we call it unboxing.

            int b = -6;
            Integer b2 = -9009;

            b = b2;
